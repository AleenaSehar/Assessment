# React Assessment Project

This project is a small React application built for an assessment.  
It fetches data from the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)  
and demonstrates React fundamentals, routing, state management, and UI design with Tailwind CSS.


## Features
- **Display Users**  
  - Fetch users from the API and display them in a responsive card layout.  
  - View individual user details by clicking on a user.  

- **Posts Module**  
  - Fetch posts from the API and display them in a clean UI.  
  - Expand/collapse comments on each post.  
  - Real-time search and sorting of posts.  

- **Add Post (Bonus)** 
  - Add a new post with form validation.  
  - Optimistic UI update (post appears instantly before API response).  

- **Navigation**  
  - Modern sticky Navbar with routes to Users and Posts.  

- **Error + Loading States**  
  - Graceful handling of fetch errors and loading states.
